# DiscordBot

This is a simple JavaScript program that utilizes nodejs and Discord's API to create a music bot for servers. At the moment the bot will join a voice channel that the user is in, and begin playing the URL specified in the initial command.

The immediate plans for SteinBot are to allow multi-server usage, and a queue command that allows multiple songs to be added & play in order.
